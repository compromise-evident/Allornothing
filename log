/* Allornothing log



Version 1       "How to run the program" has been re-written and can be placed within
                any .cpp file. Its current state will be used in all files until improved
                again (this how-to note is included in all my works.) temp_x search is now
                purposely non-algebraic but slow for clarity ("new key" or "adjusted key".)
