/* Allornothing log



Version 1.1     All about serious file overwriting (at user's permission.) Pauses, allows user to
                copy the keys onto any other devices, then if 'y' entered to continue, plainfile
                and all keys are heavily overwritten and removed (option 1.) And also in option 2:
                pauses, allows users to allow viewing/copying of the decrypted file, then if 'y'
                entered to continue, keys and file are heavily overwritten and removed. In-file
                documentation is now 80 char long--width of terminal, shorter, less eye movement.
                I should remind you that overwrites are only effective on HDDs. See OTP log: 4.1.

Version 1       "How to run the program" has been re-written and can be placed within
                any .cpp file. Its current state will be used in all files until improved
                again (this how-to note is included in all my works.) temp_x search is now
                purposely non-algebraic but slow for clarity ("new key" or "adjusted key".)
