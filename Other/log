Version 2.1     Added output-reminder on time to wait after seeds entry.
                Wednesday, April 21 2021

Version 2       Sector accident detection  (writes to disk,  reads it back, then
                compares it to  what's held in  RAM.)  File overwriting is still
                present upon user permission for killing  keys &  plainfile when
                sector accident is detected. As usual, sector_accident_detection
                is on by default and can be disabled by setting this  boolean to
                false.Updated "How to run/make executable with g++". Updated RAM
                overwriting. Placed input boundaries for when users enter seeds.
                All things compatible with  previous;  use this version at will.

Version 1.1     All about serious file overwriting (at user's permission.) Pauses, allows user to
                copy the keys onto any other devices, then if 'y' entered to continue, plainfile
                and all keys are heavily overwritten and removed (option 1.) And also in option 2:
                pauses, allows users to allow viewing/copying of the decrypted file, then if 'y'
                entered to continue, keys and file are heavily overwritten and removed. In-file
                documentation is now 80 char long--width of terminal, shorter, less eye movement.
                I should remind you that overwrites are only effective on HDDs. See OTP log: 4.1.

Version 1       "How to run the program" has been re-written and can be placed within
                any .cpp file. Its current state will be used in all files until improved
                again (this how-to note is included in all my works.) temp_x search is now
                purposely non-algebraic but slow for clarity ("new key" or "adjusted key".)
